# DoomBox
 An insane glitchy analog fuzz pedal designed for bass guitar.

## Progress

- Designed circuit and selected components on breadboard.
- Made a stripboard prototype, added a level knob and LED indicator.
- Designed PCB found herein with added power filtering (easily bypassed if it turns out to be useless).
- Waiting for the PCBs to arrive to test final assembly.
